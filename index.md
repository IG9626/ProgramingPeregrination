## My Programing Peregination
Hi!!:) If you are deciding whether or not to take on programing, let me tell you about my programing peregrination. Throughout my entire life I thought programing was the most boring and dumbest thing I could do. I thought that it was more boring than watching grass grow, or paint dry. I was entirely wrong. Not only was programing very fun and interesting, but it was also very applicable to life. You can create applications such as a calculator, or a calendar that you can use every day. Not only can you make your own, but you can better understand what goes into the apps you use every day on your phone. It may or may not be something that you want to pursue as a career, but either way programing and coding surrounds our day to day lives. The following projects are the highlights of my programing peregrination.
### Screen Saver Application
One of the first applications that I learned to create was a screensaver that I could use on my computer. This application, being one of the first ones I did, was not very hard skill wise but was still daunting. To make this application I used a fun little program called processing, which is a learning platform that makes learning how to program fun and not so heavy or technical. When writing the code I used the programing language java. The concept we focused on when writing the code for the application was random, this concept is that every time your program is started it will never be the same because you can choose random lengths, widths and colors for all of the lines on the screen. When finished, it was work well done, I now had a cool little screensaver that I could put onto my computer. Here's a Pic:

### Time Line

This was still one of my earlier projects, but I was exited from the begining to do this project. I used the language Java and the program processing to create this timeline. As you can see from the picture above, this program was a timeline. The reason I was so exited, was that I felt like I could use what I learned as I did this program to complete other projects in my english and history classes that also needed timelines. I create them how I wanted and could make them look any way I wanted. In this program I learned how to code a program so that you could interact with it. In this program I did a hover function which allows a box of information appear whenever you are hovering over a date.

### Speed Converter

In this application we had the assignment to show a converter on the screen (temperature, speed, money, etc.) I decided to choose Speed. I wanted to convert miles per hour to kilometers per hour, not only that but I wanted to create what looked like speedometers onto the screen. It was very hard, the speedometers were circles and to figure out how to reference the speed onto a circle and change the hands of the speedometer as you moved the mouse across the screen was very hard. In this program I learned that math is very important when it comes to programing. I also learned that using reference sites such as: tutorials point and processing was very important in keeping my sanity and completing the project. If you take the code and try to run it on your computer you will see that some of the program is a little buggy, and still needs some fixing, but it was still a good accomplishment. Hopefully someday I will come back and fix the issues, but all in all this application was a very good learning experience. 

### Calculator
 This was the first large, multi process application that we did. It was filled with many steps, but in the end, it was well worth it. We started with a layout of what we wanted our calculator to do, and how we wanted it to look. This is what my layout looked like, I just wrote it out:

After the layout I began to code the application, I started with 2 function buttons and the display. During the making of this calculator I learned what classes were and how to use them. I also learned how to make a complex program, that had many aspects that worked together.  I got a working calculator (mostly :):) I still want to code 4 function buttons with square root, exponents, etc. I will just add that sometime in the future;) that I could potentially use! It took awhile to get a hang of the program, but in the end it was well worth it!

### Pig Latin Converter

Up to this point in class I had only used 1 language, java, it was time to expand to something new. In programing there are many different languages, java, c++, python,ext. In the end I decided to try out python. I decided to do python because it was a concise language and many people said fairly easy to learn. To write the code for this program I used IDLE, a program similar to processing, but much simpler. The application I did was a pig latin converter. It converts any word in english into pig latin. This program was very simple and allowed me to navigate the new syntax (grammar) of the new language.
