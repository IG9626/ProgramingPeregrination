## My Programing Peregination
Hi!!:) If you are deciding whether or not to take on programing, let me tell you about my programing peregrination. Throughout my entire life I thought programing was the most boring and dumbest thing I could do. I thought that it was more boring than watching grass grow, or paint dry. I was entirely wrong. Not only was programing very fun and interesting, but it was also very applicable to life. You can create applications such as a calculator, or a calendar that you can use every day. Not only can you make your own, but you can better understand what goes into the apps you use every day on your phone. It may or may not be something that you want to pursue as a career, but either way programing and coding surrounds our day to day lives. The following projects are the highlights of my programing peregrination.
### Screen Saver Application
One of the first applications that I learned to create was a screensaver that I could use on my computer. This application, being one of the first ones I did, was not very hard skill wise but was still daunting. To make this application I used a fun little program called processing, which is a learning platform that makes learning how to program fun and not so heavy or technical. When writing the code I used the programing language java. The concept we focused on when writing the code for the application was random, this concept is that every time your program is started it will never be the same because you can choose random lengths, widths and colors for all of the lines on the screen. When finished, it was work well done, I now had a cool little screensaver that I could put onto my computer. Here's a Pic:
